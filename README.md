User authenticates with Twitter, so you have access to their tweets stream. On your site's left-column, show them all the links that people whom they follow have tweeted. Then they can click a link to see that link's content on the right side.

Twitter can be useful, because people share links to interesting articles there. But there's a lot of noise too. So I would use this site to more easily read all the interesting stuff people are linking to.

This API takes a URL and returns the meaningful content from the URL's destination. E.g. it takes a NY Times link and returns just the HTML comprising the article content (so no ads, no sidebar, etc).

You could use that API to get clean content for the right-side of your application.
